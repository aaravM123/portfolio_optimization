# TASK: Clean and professionalize the entire Colab notebook for GitHub

# OBJECTIVE:
Take my working Colab notebook for the "Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization with RL (PyTorch)" project and restructure it into a clean, professional notebook that I can push to GitHub. The notebook should tell a clear story, with code + markdown documentation for each phase of the project.

# STRUCTURE OF THE FINAL NOTEBOOK:

1. Title + Overview
   - Add a project title cell: "Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization (PyTorch)"
   - Add a short markdown overview explaining:
     - Goal: Build RL agent that allocates across 5 asset classes
     - Tools: PyTorch, Gym-style environment, yfinance
     - Deliverables: custom environment, RL agent, backtest plots

2. Phase 1 — Data Collection
   - Markdown: Explain assets used (SPY, TLT, GLD, USO, UUP).
   - Code: yfinance download, returns calculation, save to CSV.
   - Output: Preview of `asset_returns.csv`.

3. Phase 2 — Environment Design
   - Markdown: Explain custom Gym environment ("PortfolioEnv").
   - Code: Define environment (long-only, returns-based reward).
   - Code: Quick test with random actions and plot portfolio growth.

4. Phase 3 — Policy Network (RL Agent Brain)
   - Markdown: Explain PyTorch policy network and REINFORCE algorithm.
   - Code: Define `PolicyNetwork`.
   - Code: Simple training loop (100 episodes).
   - Output: Reward plot.

5. Phase 4 — Training & Evaluation
   - Markdown: Explain extended training and evaluation vs baselines.
   - Code: Extended training with checkpoints.
   - Code: Backtest (2018–today) vs Equal-Weight and SPY.
   - Output: Metrics and performance plot.

6. Phase 5 — Realism Upgrades
   - Markdown: Explain enhancements:
     - Transaction costs
     - Sharpe-adjusted rewards
     - Optional shorting
   - Code: Enhanced `PortfolioEnv`.
   - Code: Retrain agent (200+ episodes).
   - Output: Reward plot.

7. Phase 5 — Backtest with Costs and Sharpe
   - Markdown: Explain inference only (no learning).
   - Code: Backtest Phase 5-trained agent vs baselines.
   - Output: Final portfolio growth plot and metrics.

8. Phase 6 — Extensions (Optional, Future Work)
   - Markdown only: List possible extensions:
     - Shorting
     - More assets
     - Macro features
     - Advanced RL algorithms (PPO, A2C)
     - Regime-switching agents

9. Conclusion
   - Markdown summary:
     - SPY outperformed in raw return
     - RL agent performed close to equal-weight, smoother profile
     - The value is the full pipeline: data → environment → agent → backtest
     - Notes on limitations and next steps

# FORMATTING:
- Add markdown headers: "## Phase X: ..." for each phase.
- Use bullet points for clarity.
- Add short inline comments in code (1–2 lines max).
- Ensure plots have titles, labels, and legends.
- Hide warnings (`warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")` at top).
- Make notebook clean: no redundant debug prints, only meaningful outputs.

---

# OUTPUT:
- A single cleaned Jupyter/Colab notebook (`rl_portfolio_rl.ipynb`)
- Clear flow from start to finish
- Can be exported directly to GitHub repo with professional readability
